 With the growth of domestic robot industry, it is important to understand
 the navigation of mobile robots in dynamic environments.
 Use of mobile robots in the home can greatly improve the quality of life
 and is a growing field of research.
 An important aspect to be considered is the aspect of safety and guarantees
 that can be made about the safety of controllers on such robots.
 Given traditional digital control, mobile robot dynamics are often linearized
 to a setpoint and the controller is set to follow a point some distance

 from the robot.
 The proposed study will attempt to characterize the stability of such a
 robotic system.
 We propose to study the applicability of barrier functions to prove the
 stability of the system given its set of constraints and the space it's
 allowed to operate in.
 The formulation of this problem in this form allows us to make claims about
 the stability of the control law, and study the conditions under which
 we can guarantee the success of the controller.
 The overall objective of the project is to apply barrier functions to generate
 a nonlinear control policy for a Segway RMP based robot.

\begin_layout Standard
Navigation is a fundamental concern for mobile robots.
 The ability to successfully avoid obstacles, both static and dynamic, while
 moving towards a goal location largely determines the utility of a mobile
 robotic platform.
 It is important that robots avoid obstacles for their own safety as well
 as the safety of the people around them.
 Given the importance of navigation, it is not surprising that the problem
 has long been considered and explored; furthermore, it is reasonable to
 assert that approaches to the problem are as varied as the disciplines
 related to robotics themselves.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this paper, we propose to use nonlinear control techniques (barrier functions
) for robot navigation and collision avoidance.
 We define constraints important for navigation like distance from obstacle,
 minimum and maximum velocity, minimum and maximum rotational velocity,
 and velocity as a function of distance from obstacle for safety to generate
 a navigation law for the robot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Nonlinear control based navigation is also a studied problem such as by
 Ting et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Generating a policy in a reactive fashion reduces the complexity of the
 computation needed.
 Traditional path planners can be used to provide a high level trajectory
 by having some previous metric knowledge of the space.
 Lower level reactive controllers can be used for local refinement of the
 global path and can be used to control the robot.
 This reduces the complexity of re-planning every time a change in the environme
nt is observed.
 Potential field based algorithms have been used to generate such reactive
 policies in the past with some success.
 There are some known pitfalls for this method with regards to local minima
 but several solutions for this have been proposed.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Given the possibility of having a global metric representation of a domestic
 environment, we could generate a global trajectory and local non-linear
 controller that obeys the bounds imposed on the robot.
 If the barrier function comprises of the above information, we can make
 claims guarantees about the stability of the robot with respect to those
 objectives.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The navigation law will first be tested and verified in simulation.
 MATLAB will be used for this purpose.
 Once the simulations verify the algorithm, the controller will be implemented
 in the ROS framework and evaluated in a robot simulation environment (Gazebo).
 The final experiments will be performed on the mobile robot Jeeves, shown
 in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

\end_inset

, which will be used as a test platform for the real world environment.
 We plan to study the law developed in both static and dynamic environments.

\begin_layout Standard
The robot platform shown in Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:jeeves"

\end_inset

 consists of a Segway RMP-200 mobile base, which has been modified to hold
 various sensors.
 The Seqway RMP 200 has been modified to be statically stable but for the
 purposes of this project, the casters shall be removed and 8020 adjustments
 will be made on the side of the robot to prevent it from tipping (inspired
 by Figure 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:mod_jeeves"

\end_inset

).
 The sensor suite on the robot consists of a Roboteye RE05 sensor capable
 of scanning in 3D, a primesense RGB-D camera and a Kinect RGB-D.
 The Hokuyo LTM-30x is mounted at the base and used for base obstacle avoidance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the scope of this project, the Hokuyo LTM-30x is used to detect obstacles
 from a planar scan.
 The closest laser hit can be considered an obstacle and dynamic obstacles
 can be modelled in this way.
 A microstrain IMU is mounted on the robot to estimate the state of the
 robot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The robot is controlled using a PS3 controller when in tele-operation mode,
 which has a manual override and a dead-man switch to kill the robot due
 to any type of failure.
 The robot is also permanently connected to a computer that is monitoring
 the robot and can be used to kill running programs on the robot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The dynamics (discussed in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

) of the Segway RMP base can be modelled as a cart with an inverted pendulum
 which can be modelled as:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\begin{equation}
\centering mLsin(\theta)\dot{\theta}^{2}+(M+m)\dot{v}-F-mLcos(\theta)\ddot{\theta}=0
\end{equation}

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
where 
\begin_inset Formula $\theta$
\end_inset

 is the angle of the pendulum with respect to its vertical position, 
\begin_inset Formula $v$
\end_inset

 is the speed of the base, 
\begin_inset Formula $F$
\end_inset

 is the force on the cart, 
\begin_inset Formula $M$
\end_inset

 is the mass of the cart and 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 is the mass of the pendulum and 
\begin_inset Formula $L$
\end_inset

 is the length of the massless rod.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The control law will further be used to test how it affects the dynamics
 of the system.
 We will measure the translation and the rotational velocities and the tip
 angle to verify that the control policy doesn't force the robot to go beyond
 its boundary conditions and ensures its safety.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Objective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of this project is to come up with a nonlinear control policy
 for navigation of mobile robots.
 To do this appropriate constraints have to be determined and specified.
 The initial constraints will be : 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
The distance between the robotic platform and obstacles in the environment
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Minimum and maximum translational velocities of the robot 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Minimum and maximum angular velocities of the robot 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These constraints will be used to generate a navigation controller for the
 Segway robot to ensure that the constraints are obeyed.
 Later, more constraints may be added to ensure safety of the robot and
 humans around the robot.
 The stability of the system with respect to the Lyapunov-like barrier functions
 will be analysed.
 This allows us to study theoretical guarantees of the controller for the
 Segway robot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The experimental objective is to implement this controller on a real robot
 and study the gap between theory and practice in experimental scenarios.
 In the context of the system of interest, the nonlinear controller is used
 to study the robustness and stability of the generated control policy in
 the presence of obstacles in a real world scenario.

Simulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The nonlinear control policy developed will be simulated in MATLAB to ensure
 expected behaviour of the algorithm and to evaluate it for different boundary
 conditions of the algorithm.
 The simulated environment will be shown as MATLAB GUI where the robot and
 obstacles are simulated and different randomized configurations of obstacles
 and several runs of the algorithm will be used to test the controller.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Robot specific simulation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The controller shall be implemented in the ROS framework and simulated using
 the Gazebo simulator for Jeeves.
 The simulation scenario would involve synthetic worlds and successful navigatio
n in these worlds with the presence of introduced noise in the sensor reading
 and encoder measurement of the robot.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Robot experiments
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, the controller will be implemented on the Segway robot for experimental
 evaluation.
 The experimental evaluation will consist of five navigation test cases
 in which the robot will be instructed to navigate a static environment.
 Stability of the Segway will be examined for each test case and will be
 used to support the theoretical claims.
 The experiments will be performed in a motion capture room consisting of
 an 8 camera Optitrack system where the state of both obstacles and the
 robot can be measured.
 This will allow us to show the performance of the controller in the presence
 of both perfect and imperfect information.
 Further testing will include the addition of dynamic obstacles, such as
 people, to explore the capabilities of the proposed controller.
